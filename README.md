# Secure Flask Web Application

This is a simple, secure Flask web application that demonstrates user registration, login, and a basic dashboard. It incorporates several security best practices and can serve as a starting point for building secure web applications with Flask.

## Features

- User registration with secure password hashing
- User login with session management
- Basic dashboard for logged-in users
- SQL injection prevention using SQLAlchemy ORM
- CSRF protection
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment-based configuration

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-flask-app.git
   cd secure-flask-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   export SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
   export FLASK_ENV='development'
   ```
   Note: In a production environment, ensure `FLASK_ENV` is set to 'production'.

## Usage

1. Initialize the database:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Security Features

This application implements several security best practices:

1. **Secure Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt for password hashing.
2. **CSRF Protection**: Implements CSRF protection using Flask-WTF.
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.
4. **Secure Session Management**: Utilizes Flask's secure session management.
5. **Environment-based Configuration**: Separates development and production configurations.
6. **Input Validation**: Implements basic input validation for user inputs.

## Security Considerations

While this application implements several security best practices, it's important to note:

1. This is a sample application and may not cover all security aspects needed for a production environment.
2. Always keep your dependencies up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.
3. Regularly review and update your security measures.
4. In a production environment, ensure you're using HTTPS.
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring.
6. Consider additional security measures like rate limiting and two-factor authentication for enhanced security.
